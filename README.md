# Analysis of Expectations of Common People for Candidate in Parliament
Conducted a survey-based statistical and machine learning analysis on 520 respondents to identify voter expectations for parliamentary candidates using EDA, Chi-square tests, sentiment analysis, and predictive ML models.



# Key Findings
1)Voters prioritize education, integrity, and governance experience as the most important qualities in parliamentary candidates, with transparency and accountability strongly      influencing trust.
2) Broad public support exists for women’s representation in Parliament, aligning with the objectives of the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam (2023).
3) Age significantly affects political expectations: younger voters focus on development, employment, and future-ready leadership, while older voters value stability and  
  experience.
4) Chi-square analysis confirmed significant associations between voter demographics (especially age and education) and expectations from parliamentary candidates.
5) Advanced machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) outperformed Logistic Regression, identifying candidate education, leadership skills, transparency, and 
  inclusivity as key predictors of voter preference.
